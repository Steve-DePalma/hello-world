# hello-world
First attempt at creating a repository.
And here's my first "edit" of the readme file.
There will be much more to come, maybe after lunch.
# One hash
That was just one hash.
## Two hashes
There goes two hashes.
### Three hashes
And that was three hashes!
Will there be more?
```bash
$ git config one
$ git config two
$ for f in *.txt; do wc -l $f; done
$ ls *.bam *.bai
```
How does that look? Be honest.
```perl
foreach my $file (keys %files) {
  printf "%s\n", $file;
}
```
How does the Perl code look?
